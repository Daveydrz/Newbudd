Subjective Experience - Personal Interpretation and Qualia Modeling

This module implements subjective experience processing that:
- Provides personal interpretation and reflection on experiences
- Models qualia-like subjective state representation
- Captures "what it's like" to be this AI system
- Enables experiential meaning-making and personal significance
- Tracks consciousness state introspection and self-experience
